# fira code issues

the currently available packages in the offical arch repos and the aur are borked.
at least for dmenu and dwm.

the _one_ package that did work was removed from `community` because i-dont-know.

that's why `otf-fira-code-1.207-1-any.pkg.tar.xz` is included in my dotfiles.

install with `pacman -U`.

\> why stay on this version?

because i've been fucking around with font issues for 40 minutes now and don't care anymore...
this version works and it works well. 
any version beyond this has either issues with terminal emulators, the suckless programs or whatever.
and don't even get me started on font config issues with `ttf-fira-code` and how the spacing is _never_ correct in all programs with that package...
